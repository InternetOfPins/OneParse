PlatformIO custom targets for HLS synthesis via Intel HLS Compiler (i++).

Independent, third HLS backend cross-check for hls_smoke -- see
README.md's Cross-tool/cross-config validation section.

    pio run -e hls-intel -t synthesize-tiny-intel
    pio run -e hls-intel -t synthesize-buffer-intel

Requires `i++` on PATH (installed via Quartus Prime Lite + Intel HLS
Compiler -- not bundled/auto-installed here, see README.md for account/
install instructions). NOT run as part of this pass: no Intel HLS
Compiler install was available, so this is integration scaffolding only,
pending that install.

CROSS-VENDOR DEVICE CAVEAT: Intel HLS Compiler's free Lite edition is
gated to specific Altera/Intel device families (e.g. Cyclone V), NOT
Xilinx parts -- this cannot target the same xc7a100t-1csg324-VVD used by
the Bambu/Vitis runs. DEVICE below is a placeholder; confirm the actual
supported device list against the installed version before running, and
keep any resulting numbers labeled as a different device family, not
directly comparable to the Xilinx-targeted columns.

The `i++` flags below follow Intel's documented component-compiler
syntax but were NOT verified against a real install (none available in
this pass) -- re-check `i++ --help` / current Intel HLS Compiler docs
before the first real run.
